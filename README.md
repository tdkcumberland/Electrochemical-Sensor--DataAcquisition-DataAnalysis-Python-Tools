# Electrochemical Sensor Response Data Analysis
During my master's degree research, I worked on developing electrochemical gas sensors for law enforcement and healthcare industry.

The data I recieved from the DMM were in text format and I had a lot of it. So I created this script to allow my team and myself to batch process the data. 

I also made a another scripts to control my pumps for my experiments.

Scripts were created with Python 3.6 and can be used as they are after installing the depencies.
