# Electrochemical Sensor Response Data Analysis
During my master's degree research, I worked on developing electrochemical gas sensors for law enforcement and healthcare industry.

The electrical signal I recieved from the DMM were in text format and I had a boat load of it (35,000 CSV lines per data point). So I created this script to allow my team and myself to process the dataset in batch. 

I also made a another scripts to control my air/sample pumps for my experiments. This script was a modification of NumatoLab 2-relay module example code.

Scripts were created with Python 3.6 and can be used as they are after installing the required libraries.
